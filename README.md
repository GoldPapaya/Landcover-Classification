# Landcover-Classification
This app uses supervised machine learning to seperate and visualize terrain classes of the UK in EarthEngine. 
I manually selected 212 points in the UK to train the model (full breakdown below), and the result looks spectacular!

Dispite a tiny amount of sample data, the product looks very good! Observe that crops, forests, and water are represented
especially well. 

Cities and barren land appear similar visibly, so there are a lot of expected errors around the Scottish highlands
and city sprawl.
